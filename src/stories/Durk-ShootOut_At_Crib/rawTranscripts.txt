I I know this is some random ass beef
 
especially cause Lil Man man and baby
 
are both from the West Side Lil Baby is
 
from Oakland and man man is from West
 
End their hoods are just next to each
 
other so Lil Baby knows a lot of the
 
guys there who he grew up and also the
 
young guys who are causing [ __ ] out
 
there most of Lil baby's young [ __ ]
 
the hot boys went to school with a
 
Glizzy Gang they used to be cool before
 
everything went down and there were
 
rumors that man man was gun assigned to
 
4pf one thing about the Glizzy Gang or
 
man man allegedly they love breaking
 
into cars and stealing [ __ ] man man's so
 
good at stealing cars they call him baby
 
driver like the movie that's why his
 
always in and out of jail can't stay
 
free to save his life Lil Man man also
 
go into a shootout with police after
 
doing car theft with his buddies and
 
were found with lots of guns and ammo
 
now you get the picture of who this kid
 
is now the beef started just three
 
months before Lil Baby and Dirk dropped
 
voice of the heroes if you remember
 
around that time they were super locked
 
in together Dirk even raps a few not 4pf
 
I think out loud and Lil Baby raps I'm
 
so 4pf but I pop out with OTF just by
 
this you understand how close they are
 
allegedly the Glizzy Gang broke into
 
King Von's Lil sister's car and stole
 
her chain just how they do so now with
 
King Von gone OTF had to show Kayla that
 
even with Von gone they are still here
 
for her and will protect her just off
 
vong's face and everything will be
 
handled
 
at first Lil Durk tried to fix this on
 
some it was a mistake let them bring it
 
back and we good so he told Lil Baby
 
cause that's his City and he knows the
 
Glizzy gangs so baby could fix it and
 
squash it cause he cool with both sides
 
so what does superhero baby do he gets
 
to that just like the time when two
 
chains had his hard drive with music
 
stolen Lil Baby got it back for him and
 
two chains thanked him on IG same way P
 
from QC got his car stolen and hard
 
drive took Lil Baby was able to get it
 
back cause he in tune with the streets
 
and that's what he was into before music
 
this is the reason Dirk calls him the
 
hero but also cause of prison [ __ ] I
 
can't speak about
 
but things wouldn't go as planned for
 
the hero this time allegedly Lil Baby
 
pulled up to push up on Lil Man man and
 
his people to get the chain back and
 
those boys allegedly told him Dirk gonna
 
have to pay for it and that they ain't
 
giving it back for free cause the game
 
is the gang it don't matter who you are
 
they wanted money for the chain things
 
got heated and the crews started arguing
 
and talking hot
 
so Lil Baby left with his people
 
basically they hold my favorite rapper
 
right there and then allegedly not so
 
long after they left the Glizzy Gang
 
went and spent some rounds on Lil Baby
 
old apartments in little Cali allegedly
 
that's when it was up from there and
 
caused the Fallout between these gangs
 
which made 4pf and OTF click up forming
 
4tf vs Glizzy Gang now after some time
 
OTF Boone and Lil Man man got into it at
 
the mall with Witnesses saying it
 
started as an argument with people in
 
two different cars with guns in their
 
hand which led to a shootout in the
 
parking lap. then they took cover and
 
got in their cars but when one car tried
 
to speed off allegedly OTF boona was
 
shooting at the car in front of him
 
while hanging out the window bullets
 
would fly and hit four people out of
 
those four people a six-year-old kid got
 
hit with stray bullets but survived the
 
injuries and was found left on the curb
 
where medical assistants said the
 
injuries were none life-threatening
 
here's the video report from the scene
 
now at the scene of the shooting boona
 
dropped his cell phone during the
 
shooting and police were able to track
 
him down through social media activity
 
to tie him to the shooting and seems
 
like OTF has caused trouble in Atlanta
 
for authorities as this wasn't the first
 
remember the king Von and Lil Durk
 
shooting that happened as well also the
 
king Von won with kwanda authorities
 
have now named OTF as an active street
 
gang
 
now I ask myself why boona had a cell
 
phone there did they maybe just run into
 
each other did they get the drop on him
 
or did he come there to meet up with
 
them cause if it was an intentional
 
shootout he wouldn't have gone with a
 
cell phone right
 
all of them got arrested after some time
 
and Buna got sent news to eight years in
 
prison keep in mind that boona had just
 
served eight years before this and he
 
was only home for three years till this
 
shooting happened which would get him
 
another eight years Lil Man man is also
 
doing time but he posted that he would
 
be out on the 6th of June 2023 so he
 
will be out soon
 
four months after the shooting at the
 
mall Lil durk's house got broken into
 
and the shootout happened by now we all
 
know who likes to break into people's
 
cars and houses so allegedly this was
 
retaliation for the shooting and
 
allegedly India didn't even pick up the
 
gun it was all dirt but he had to say
 
India's shot back cause he is a felon
 
and was still fighting a case
 
a lot of gangsters stuff happened
 
between both camps and after some time a
 
kid named Mark who was part of Glizzy
 
Gang got shot and killed with
 
allegations saying it's all tied to this
 
beef after Mark got hit four PF members
 
or the hot boys started clowning him
 
things would only get worse as after
 
some time DT or is known by cold-hearted
 
Savage had a performance at Club Tru out
 
of town the performance went well but as
 
they were leaving and on the highway an
 
unknown vehicle sped up to them and
 
opened fire striking Lil mid in the head
 
there were also four other people in the
 
car but police the incident report
 
didn't say anyone else was hit the 4pf
 
Entourage drove to a hospital an hour
 
away instead of the one close by to get
 
him some help but unfortunately he
 
didn't make it and died the Glizzy Gang
 
saw it as their turn to clown the 4pf
 
group
 
so that happened and allegedly Lil
 
Baby's house also got broken into and a
 
few gold items were stolen from the
 
rapper's home as well as money and
 
jewelry that's why he bought that new
 
house now and moved out the old one
 
so to summarize this the beef started
 
cause of a chain and led to something
 
bigger with one Camp stealing from the
 
other and asking for money for the
 
return of stolen property which got Lil
 
Baby and 4pf tied up in the middle
 
forcing them to pick a side
 
so let me know what y'all think and like
 
And subscribe hey hit that subscribe
 
button you know it's free


I've told y'all how like I literally
 
found that that was gonna be a private
 
situation
 
that was gonna be a private situation
 
somebody who lived I don't want to keep
 
you know because I feel like I'm doxing
 
a [ __ ] somebody who lived around and
 
knew Dirk lived there
 
they hit me unless unless y'all was
 
trying to say Dirk told a random [ __ ]
 
to hit me but [ __ ] it was in my message
 
request from a random fan Real Page and
 
everything that's a random fan I get 10
 
000 random messages a day people giving
 
me tips on anything plus they might be
 
like yo yo little TJ just ran to the cop
 
show like look like they put him in
 
cuffs and I'd be like is that true I
 
might be like yo send me a pic of some
 
[ __ ] like that you know I mean sometimes
 
you don't know if it's true sometimes it
 
is true you feel me like that's how I
 
kind of steal my game I read every
 
message request on my main page everyone
 
now if you're talking to me uh you got
 
to do that on my personal page but I get
 
10 000 new message
 
DMS a day and I go through every one of
 
them some of them trolling some of them
 
whatever one random day I went through
 
and it said bro
 
I think there was some type of shooting
 
at Dirk's [ __ ]
 
there's mad police up there
 
and I said how the [ __ ] do you even know
 
where Dirk even lives he's like and
 
that's what he told me where Dirk lived
 
I didn't even know where Dirk lived
 
I won't say it
 
then I'm like hmm
 
then they put they gave me some more
 
proof and I'm like this might be true
 
but but if dirt not coming out to say it
 
I said we gotta wait till TMZ gets it
 
um um I I happen to talk to a [ __ ] TMZ
 
and I said yo this they said this
 
happened
 
TMZ only got connects in
 
um they pay off La cops so anything
 
happened like live in L.A you're [ __ ]
 
they literally pay off the cops for
 
everything
 
but they can't pay off every cop in the
 
[ __ ] world so like where Dirk lived
 
at the time
 
like they had to try to work their magic
 
to try to get it but they work their
 
magic and confirmed it and I was like oh
 
[ __ ] so then they ran the story
 
that's how it happened I told Dirk now
 
to his face
 
so I would think it's not staged right
 
or I'm I'm gonna play I'm gonna play I'm
 
gonna play I'm gonna play facetious or
 
normal play um cynical with y'all
 
I don't think it was staged for the
 
media right but who knows maybe it was I
 
don't know it could have been let's say
 
it was an accidental shot
 
let's say it was an accidental shot gun
 
go off
 
the police come
 
you got to say something now right you
 
get the police to write it up as oh
 
somebody was breaking in and a gunshot
 
got fired you know what I mean maybe
 
that happened I don't know
 
but a shot got fired
 
they told the cops cops that there was
 
somebody trying to come in clearly the
 
cops must have corroborated it because
 
when you when TMZ reached out and asked
 
for it
 
you know I hate talking about this
 
because you know like like even off
 
camera me and him was talking like bro
 
he he
 
he's a [ __ ] who like that [ __ ] was
 
close to home and I'm a [ __ ] who went
 
through a situation where [ __ ] is close
 
to home you don't want to keep having to
 
re-touch up or like touch on situations
 
when you live somewhere right now we
 
don't live there no more you don't live
 
there no more but still the details of
 
that story was that they it was a gated
 
community they came through the Gated
 
Community the car that they claimed the
 
[ __ ] was in or whoever was in came
 
through the gated community
 
I don't think they had plates or nothing
 
because I don't think there was no
 
arrests behind it but they saw the car
 
coming in they never saw the car going
 
out
 
or not well
 
let me not let me not put that wasn't
 
the thing that was the thing it wasn't
 
obviously they're surveillance but it's
 
a gated community I guess that's what I
 
should say that it's a gated community
 
um I'm not gonna say they they came in
 
the the interesting thing that TMZ
 
reported I could probably pull it back
 
up is that they never saw them leaving
 
so they couldn't find after the shooting
 
of anybody leaving
 
so it was a little bit odd let me see
 
Dirk
 
shoot
 
let's see
 
uh
 
wait
 
um
 
[ __ ] I gotta search this up off here
 
okay
 
all right I'm not gonna throw it back on
 
the screen again because it kind of
 
shows where they were staying I'm good
 
um yeah but but that's what
 
when I kept doing and kept digging for
 
info on what happened yes somebody did
 
try to run up
 
shots were fired
 
the people left but the cops didn't have
 
any leads on the people which was kind
 
of odd because it made it seem like it's
 
a gated community somehow they got in
 
there but I don't know if I don't know
 
how Atlanta is built oh I just [ __ ]
 
said where but but I guess [ __ ] ran
 
through the bushes I don't know what the
 
[ __ ] happened you know what I mean so
 
um I don't know but it definitely wasn't
 
staged to go viral like no way ain't no
 
[ __ ] way that's no [ __ ] way it was
 
staged to go viral
 
um
 
now could have been some other [ __ ]
 
because Dirk really not supposed to be
 
around a gun but here's the thing with
 
this situation this is called
 
self-defense
 
this is self-defense so in self-defense
 
when y'all is saying that your girl
 
fired the gun
 
they're not gonna go charge you you get
 
what I mean
 
so again who knows if it was some other

According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigations,  around 5 am on Sunday, July 11th, Lil Durk woke up  
 
and found someone trying to break into his house  in the Chateau Elan neighborhood of Braselton, GA,  
 
which is about an hour outside of Atlanta. Durk  was home with his girlfriend and baby mama India,  
 
when they heard someone kick down the door and  they both started firing. It hasn’t been reported  
 
whether anyone was hit, but a 5 am shootout  obviously caught the attention of the neighbors. 
 
Later that morning, Durk’s home was raided  by the FBI because of the shooting and  
 
other related crimes, after the neighbors  reported it to police and media outlets.
